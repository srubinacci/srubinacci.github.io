To this aim, we propose a novel method, GLIMPSE (Genotype Likelihoods Imputation and PhaSing mEthod), that is designed for large-scale studies and reference panels, typically comprising thousands of genomes. We show the remarkable performance of GLIMPSE using low-coverage whole genome sequencing data for both European and African American populations, and we demonstrate that low-coverage sequencing can be confidently used in downstream analyses. We provide GLIMPSE as a part of an open source software suite that makes imputation for low-coverage sequencing data as convenient as for traditional SNP array platforms.","tags":["Statistical Genomics","low-coverage","imputation","phasing"],"title":"Efficient phasing and imputation of low-coverage sequencing data using large reference panels","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"The key concept in semantic artificial intelligence is the rappresentation of knowledge in terms of entities and their relationships rather than plain strings.

However reference panels of genetic variation consist of haplotype data at 100 fold more positions in the genome. Genotype imputation makes genotype predictions at all the reference panel sites using the GWAS data. Reference panels are continuing to grow in size and this improves accuracy of the predictions, however methods need to be able to scale this increased size. We have developed a new version of the popular IMPUTE software than can handle reference panels with millions of haplotypes, and has better performance than other published approaches. A notable property of the new method is that it scales sub-linearly with reference panel size. Keeping the number of imputed markers constant, a 100 fold increase in reference panel size requires less than twice the computation time.","tags":["Statistical Genomics","snp-arrays","imputation"],"title":"Genotype imputation using the Positional Burrows Wheeler Transform","type":"publication"},{"authors":["John E.

However, most of the knowledge bases available on the Web of Data do not provide temporal information explicitly. Hence, the relationship between facts and time intervals is often lost. A few solutions are proposed in this field. Most of them are concentrated more in extracting facts with time intervals rather than trying to map facts with time intervals. This paper studies the problem of determining the temporal scopes of facts, that is, deciding the time intervals in which the fact is valid. We propose a generic approach which addresses this problem by curating temporal information of facts in the knowledge bases. Our proposed framework, Temporal Information Scoping (TISCO) exploits evidence collected from the Web of Data and the Web. The evidence is combined within a three-step approach which comprises matching, selection and merging. This is the first work employing matching methods that consider both a single fact or a group of facts at a time. We evaluate our approach against a corpus of facts as input and different parameter settings for the underlying algorithms. Our results suggest that we can detect temporal information for facts from DBpedia with an f-measure of up to 80%.","tags":["Semantic Artificial Intelligence","Semantic Web","Temporal Scoping"],"title":"TISCO: Temporal scoping of facts","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"General purpose simulation packages aimed at multi-scale cell-based modelling can help to investigate the complex interplay characterizing the behavior of multicellular systems, with particular focus on the possible emergence of dysfunctional dynamical structures such as tumors.\n","date":1443312000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1610972230,"objectID":"e471644e46e4ddb76239e73b073d733b","permalink":"https://srubinacci.github.io/project/cancer_simulations/","publishdate":"2015-09-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/cancer_simulations/","section":"project","summary":"Multiscale cell-level simulations of soft tissues and cancer.","tags":["Cancer Simulations"],"title":"Cancer Simulations","type":"project"},{"authors":["Simone Rubinacci","Alex Graudenzi","Giulio Caravagna","Giancarlo Mauri","James Osborne","Joe Pitt-Francis","Marco Antoniotti"],"categories":["Simulations"],"content":" Click the Cite button above to import publication metadata into your reference management software.

Chaste is a widely used and versatile computational framework for the multiscale modeling and simulation of multicellular biological systems. The plugin, named CoGNaC (Chaste and Gene Networks for Cancer), allows the linking of the regulatory dynamics to key properties of the cell cycle and of the differentiation process in populations of cells, which can subsequently be modeled using different spatial modeling scenarios. The approach of CoGNaC focuses on the emergent dynamical behavior of gene networks, in terms of gene activation patterns characterizing the different cellular phenotypes of real cells and, especially, on the overall robustness to perturbations and biological noise. The integration of this approach within Chaste's modular simulation framework provides a powerful tool to model multicellular systems, possibly allowing for the formulation of novel hypotheses on gene regulation, cell differentiation, and, in particular, cancer emergence and development. In order to demonstrate the usefulness of CoGNaC over a range of modeling paradigms, two example applications are presented. The first of these concerns the characterization of the gene activation patterns of human T-helper cells. The second example is a multiscale simulation of a simplified intestinal crypt, in which, given certain conditions, tumor cells can emerge and colonize the tissue.","tags":["Cancer Simulations","multiscale modeling","gene regulatory networks","cell differentiation","attractors","cancer development","chaste"],"title":"CoGNaC: A Chaste Plugin for the Multiscale Simulation of Gene Regulatory Networks Driving the Spatial Dynamics of Tissues and Cancer","type":"publication"}]
