The release of whole genome sequencing data for 150,119 UK Biobank (UKB) samples represents an unprecedented opportunity to impute lcWGS with high accuracy. However, despite recent progress1,2, current methods struggle to cope with the growing numbers of samples and markers in modern reference panels, resulting in unsustainable computational costs. For instance, the imputation cost for a single genome is 1.11£ using GLIMPSE v1.1.1 (GLIMPSE1) on the UKB research analysis platform (RAP) and rises to 242.8£ using QUILT v1.0.4. To overcome this computational burden, we introduce GLIMPSE v2.0.0 (GLIMPSE2), a major improvement of GLIMPSE, that scales sublinearly in both the number of samples and markers. GLIMPSE2 imputes a low-coverage genome from the UKB reference panel for only 0.08£ in compute cost while retaining high accuracy for both ancient and modern genomes, particularly at rare variants (MAF ","tags":["low-coverage","imputation","phasing"],"title":"Imputation of low-coverage sequencing data from 150,119 UK Biobank genomes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["simone rubinacci","diogo ribeiro","robin hofmeister","olivier delaneau"],"categories":["imputation"],"content":"","date":1609977600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1675457868,"objectID":"83a4c20150f84795cca81a0983e47be1","permalink":"https://srubinacci.github.io/publication/glimpse-2021/","publishdate":"2020-08-14T14:25:59+03:00","relpermalink":"/publication/glimpse-2021/","section":"publication","summary":"In this work, we address the challenge of genotype imputation and haplotype phasing of low-coverage sequencing datasets using a reference panel of haplotypes. To this aim, we propose a novel method, GLIMPSE (Genotype Likelihoods Imputation and PhaSing mEthod), that is designed for large-scale studies and reference panels, typically comprising thousands of genomes. We show the remarkable performance of GLIMPSE using low-coverage whole genome sequencing data for both European and African American populations, and we demonstrate that low-coverage sequencing can be confidently used in downstream analyses. We provide GLIMPSE as a part of an open source software suite that makes imputation for low-coverage sequencing data as convenient as for traditional SNP array platforms.","tags":["low-coverage","imputation","phasing"],"title":"Efficient phasing and imputation of low-coverage sequencing data using large reference panels","type":"publication"},{"authors":["gorzynski et al."],"categories":["sars-cov-2","covid19","sequencing","swabs","imputation"],"content":"","date":1595808000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600182192,"objectID":"b866cf7c0f8df86c624ef475774eade2","permalink":"https://srubinacci.github.io/publication/covid-met-2020/","publishdate":"2020-08-14T01:25:59+03:00","relpermalink":"/publication/covid-met-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"We developed a scalable, high throughput approach to generate high fidelity low pass whole genome and HLA sequencing, viral genomes, and representation of human transcriptome from single nasopharyngeal swabs of COVID19 patients.","tags":[],"title":"High-throughput SARS-CoV-2 and host genome sequencing from single nasopharyngeal swabs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["simone rubinacci","olivier delaneau","jonathan marchini"],"categories":["imputation"],"content":"","date":1571011200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1600182192,"objectID":"6c972d84cb6087812e6156067973847a","permalink":"https://srubinacci.github.io/publication/impute5-2020/","publishdate":"2020-08-14T14:25:59+03:00","relpermalink":"/publication/impute5-2020/","section":"publication","summary":"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) typically use microarray technology to measure genotypes at several hundred thousand positions in the genome. However reference panels of genetic variation consist of haplotype data at 100 fold more positions in the genome. Genotype imputation makes genotype predictions at all the reference panel sites using the GWAS data. Reference panels are continuing to grow in size and this improves accuracy of the predictions, however methods need to be able to scale to increased size. We have developed a new version of the popular IMPUTE software than can handle referenece panels with millions of haplotypes, and has better performance than other published approaches. A notable property of the new method is that it scales sub-linearly with reference panel size. Keeping the number of imputed markers constant, a 100 fold increase in reference panel size requires less than twice the computation time.","tags":[],"title":"Genotype imputation using the Positional Burrows Wheeler Transform","type":"publication"}]
